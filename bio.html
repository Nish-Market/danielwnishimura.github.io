I figured graphic design would be a more stable alternative while still letting me be creative.
I've been having fun so far, but I will admit that I was dreading this web design class, as there are few things I hate more than coding.
It's big reason why I gave up on engineering my freshman year of college. However, regardless of my personal feelings, it is an important skill to have in today's job market.
I also needed to update my portfolio anyway, so why not kill two birds with one stone?</div>
